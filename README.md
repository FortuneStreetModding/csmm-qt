## Getting Started
### Installing
Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/FortuneStreetModding/csmm-qt/releases) page and download the latest version for your system. Linux users will also need to install [libssl](https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal-updates/libssl1.1) for network functionality.

### Using CSMM
For help using CSMM, please see the [CSMM User Manual](https://github.com/FortuneStreetModding/fortunestreetmodding.github.io/wiki/CSMM-User-Manual).

## Building from Source

**IMPORTANT: Make sure to use --recursive when cloning this repository, in order to initialize the submodules!**

### Build Requirements

- Qt 6.6.1
- CMake
- MSVC 2019 or later (Windows)

### Initial Steps
To start, clone this repository recursively Adding the `--recursive` flag is important as doing so will initialize the linked submodules:

`git clone git@github.com:FortuneStreetModding/csmm-qt.git --recursive`

### Windows
Before you start, ensure [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) is installed on your computer. When you deploy the Windows executable, you'll need to copy the `libssl` and `libcrypto` DLLs that come with OpenSSL into the binary's directory once the application has been built.

Windows uses the `yaml-cpp` and `libbecquerel` submodules in this repo, so there's no need to install these dependencies separately.

Just open `CMakeLists.txt` with Qt Creator and build the project with CMake.

### MacOS
Mac users can most easily install `csmm-qt`'s dependencies using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

`brew install libarchive yaml-cpp`

`libbecquerel` does not need to be installed, as the submodule linked in this repo is used instead.

Once the dependencies are installed, you can proceed to open `CMakeLists.txt` with Qt Creator and build the project with CMake.

### Linux
Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and Debian users can most easily install `csmm-qt`'s dependencies with `apt-get`:

`sudo apt-get install libyaml-cpp-dev libarchive-dev wget ninja-build libxkbcommon0 libxkbcommon-x11-0`

Users of other Linux distributions should install the above dependencies with thier favorite package manager. Just as it is with Mac OS, the Linux build process also uses the `libbecquerel` submodule linked in this repo, so it does not need to be installed separately.

Once the dependencies are installed, you can proceed to open `CMakeLists.txt` with Qt Creator and build the project with CMake.
